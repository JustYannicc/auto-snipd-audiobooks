I was hoping to get real tips and information in what could be useful to finding the components that could make up &quot;happiness&quot;, but this left me a little less than uninspired.  The audio book is pretty much Scott telling you some stories of his life, but it seems a lengthy process to get to the point, In addition, the author's somewhat monotone voice was a little difficult to listen to for 3 hours. So I ended up skipping around trying to find something useful I could apply to my own life. In the end, I skipped around so much from disinterest that I gave up maybe halfway through. Maybe some people liked it, but it wasn't for me. I couldn't find any takeaways from it.",

In the classroom, on his blog, and in YouTube videos garnering millions of views, he regularly offers hard-hitting answers to the big questions: What's the formula for a life well lived? How can you have a meaningful career, not just a lucrative one? Is work/life balance possible? What are the elements of a successful relationship? </p> <p><i>The Algebra of Happiness: Notes on the Pursuit of Success, Love, and Meaning</i> draws on Professor Galloway's mix of anecdotes and no-BS insight to share hard-won wisdom about life's challenges, along with poignant personal stories.</p> <p>Whether it's advice on if you should drop out of school to be an entrepreneur (it might have worked for Steve Jobs, but you're probably not Steve Jobs), ideas on how to position yourself in a crowded job market (do something \"boring\" and move to a city; passion is for people who are already rich), discovering what the most important decision in your life is (it's not your job, your car, or your zip code), or arguing that our relationships to others are ultimately all that matter, Galloway entertains, inspires, and provokes.</p> <p>Brash, funny, and surprisingly moving, <i>The Algebra of Happiness</i> represents a refreshing perspective on our need for both professional success and personal fulfillment and makes the perfect gift for any new graduate or for anyone who feels adrift.</p>",

They also face unprecedented challenges, including inflation, labor and housing shortages, and climate volatility. Even the notion of retirement is undergoing a profound rethink, as our lifespans extend and our relationship with work evolves. In this environment, the tried-and-true financial advice our parents followed is no longer enough. It’s time for a new playbook.</p> <p>In <i>The Algebra of Wealth</i>, Scott Galloway lays bare the rules of financial success in today’s economy. In his characteristic unvarnished, no-BS style, he explains what you need to know in order to better your chances for economic security no matter what. You’ll learn:</p> <ul> <li>How to find and follow your talent, not your passion, when making career decisions</li> <li>How to ride and optimize big economic waves (hard truth: market dynamics always trump individual achievement)</li> <li>What small steps you can take that pay big returns later, including diversification and tax planning</li> <li>How stoicism can help you minimize spending and develop better financial habits</li> </ul> <p>Brimming with wise, game-changing advice from one of the world’s most popular business school professors, <i>The Algebra of Wealth </i>offers a powerful framework for making the most of what opportunities come your way.</p>",

For more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods - that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors. </p> <p>Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like \"guilt\", \"sin\", and \"redemption\") derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong. We are still fighting these battles today without knowing it. </p>",

It has also cursed it with urban slums, powerless workers, and the vicious boom-and-bust economy. </p> <p>Attempts to lessen the problems of capitalism have also lessened its benefits. An overtaxed economy stops producing miracles. Business owners give up, discouraged from making their fortunes, and improving our lives with their products. </p> <p>If only there were some way to fix the problems of capitalism and keep all its benefits.</p> <p>In 1897, Henry George published his solution to this puzzle, <i>Progress and Poverty</i>. He suggested that, unlike all other taxes, a tax on land doesn't discourage entrepreneurship. A single tax on land can raise the revenues we need to help the poor without destroying the incentive to create wealth. Socialist goals achieved with capitalism, conservative and revolutionary all at once, George's solution impressed some of the greatest minds in history.</p> <p>Leo Tolstoy, the legendary novelist and pacifist anarchist, kept a picture of Henry George on his wall. Albert Einstein wrote, “Men like Henry George are rare unfortunately. One cannot imagine a more beautiful combination of intellectual keenness, artistic form and fervent love of justice.” The President of the United States, Rutherford B. Hayes, wrote, “Henry George is strong when he portrays the rottenness of the present system,” but he quickly added, “We are, to say the least, not yet ready for his remedy.”</p> <p>Perhaps now, we are ready for his remedy.</p> <p>If Einstein was impressed, there must be <i>something </i>to it.</p> <p>Opening credits music: \"Palakiko Blues\", recorded by Louise and Ferera, 1917</p> <p>Closing credits music: \"My Old Kentucky Home\", recorded by Louise and Ferera, 1915</p>",

However, these institutions' structures enable them to circumvent regulations that aim at protecting the markets. In addition to pointing out the problem, the author offers practical solutions. \r<br />\r<br />If you are interested in how investors influence the market, this book is for you. It paints the whole picture with data, history, unexpected (but entirely predictable) changes in nature/governance structures, and potential impacts. \r<br />\r<br />If you want juicy gossip or fun conspiracy theories since the book's subtitle kind of hints at it, this book is cool-headed and sobering. But you will learn something new. \r<br />\r<br />It spells out the nagging feeling at the back of my mind clearly.\r<br />\r<br />",

The Big Three index funds of Vanguard, State Street, and BlackRock control more than twenty percent of the votes of S&P 500 companies—a concentration of power that’s unprecedented in America.</p> <p>Then there’s the rise of private equity funds such as the Big Four of Apollo, Blackstone, Carlyle and KKR, which has amassed $2.7 trillion of assets, and are eroding the legitimacy and accountability of American capitalism, not by controlling public companies, but by taking them over entirely, and removing them from the government’s regulation.</p> <p>What can be done to check this level of power? Harvard law professor John Coates argues that only politics can fight the problem of twelve.</p> <p><b>* This audiobook edition includes a downloadable PDF that contains charts and illustrations from the book.</b></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>",

He was broke and searching for belonging in a world that didn’t understand him. That is, until he serendipitously met Thomas, who not only felt the same way he did, but had a project in mind: Together, along with two more like-minded strangers, they were going to move into a one-bedroom apartment and film themselves doing 30 things they had never done before in 30 days.<br /> <br /> That summer project changed their lives forever: it pushed them out of their comfort zones, bonded them for life, and allowed them to reach a wide audience online. Their journey would eventually become Yes Theory, a massive movement of millions of people living by the philosophy of seeking discomfort.<br /> <br /> In this memoir, Matt reveals the extreme highs and lows of Yes Theory, sharing his own along the way. This is a story about the sacrifices it takes to make a dream come true, what happens when a small group of friends suddenly have the attention of millions of strangers online, and what it means to say goodbye when everything seems to be going so well.<br /> <br /> But most of all, it’s a reminder to ask yourself that most important question: what do you want out of life?</p>",

That the road to success is lined with endless frustration and toil. But what if there's another way?</p> <p>Dr Ali Abdaal - the world's most-followed productivity expert - has uncovered an easier, happier path to success. Drawing on decades of psychological research, he has found that the secret to productivity and success isn't grind - it's <i>feeling good</i>. If you can make your work feel good, then productivity takes care of itself.</p> <p>In this revolutionary book, Ali reveals how the science of feel-good productivity can transform your life. He introduces the three hidden 'energisers' that underpin enjoyable productivity, the three 'blockers' we must overcome to beat procrastination, and the three 'sustainers' that prevent burnout and help us achieve lasting fulfilment. He recounts the inspiring stories of founders, Olympians, and Nobel-winning scientists who embody the principles of Feel-Good Productivity. And he introduces the simple, actionable changes that you can use to achieve more and live better, starting today.</p> <p>Armed with Ali's insights, you won't just accomplish more. You'll feel happier and more fulfilled along the way.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>",

For example, he compared the % of people who become alcoholics after their first experiences with alcohol with the % of people who continue to eat ultra processed food after trying it for the first time to insinuate that ALCOHOL IS LESS ADDICTIVE THAN FOOD. He also, (among a myriad of other instances which quite frankly i do not have the energy or patience to go over) used the ‘self study’ he conducted, where he ate 80% ultra processed foods, as “undeniable evidence” of the vast effects a month on the diet has. When, only pages earlier, he had talked about the frantic stress and lack of sleep he experienced on the diet and, pages before  that he talked about the staggering effects that stress hormones can have on appetite and other weight functions. All while tearing apart other studies around the positive effects of exercise (outright stating that exercise levels do not effect obesity) because of previous research projects the scientists had studied that were funded by the coca cola company. One could argue that the majority of studies cited in this book being conducted by his coworkers may also lend to some bias, and when looking over the studies myself i found some issues far more prevalent than what they may/may not have conducted reaserch on in the past. The studies he also chose to “debunk were the ones that have significant problems while he did not go over the ones with sound scientific backgrounds and data that have been redone and proven many times over. while I don’t suggest that ultra processed foods are in anyway healthy. I think that this book number of glaring problems, and is probably not the place to look for facts.",

Chances are, if you’re eating something that came wrapped in plastic and contains a funky ingredient you don’t have in your kitchen, it's most likely—almost definitely—ultra-processed food, or UPF. More than the principal obstacle to “eating right,” UPF has been linked to metabolic disease, depression, inflammation, anxiety, and cancer, while the production, distribution, and disposal of UPF and related products globally is known to cause devastating environmental damage. At the same time, UPF represents the dominant, nigh-unavoidable food culture for millions upon millions of eaters.</p> <p>Medical doctor and broadcaster Chris van Tulleken has spent his career trying to reframe the conversation around eating right, balancing the hard (and sometimes shocking) facts about what we're putting into our bodies with empathy for the natural desire to keep eating what we like, have time for, and can afford. As he argues in this book, we are all participants in an experiment we didn't consent to, one to determine how to get us to buy as much ultra-processed food as possible. It’s not as simple as stumbling across the right diet trend, finding time to meal plan, or avoiding over-indulging in sugar, fat, or carbs or any other culprit. Nor is it a matter of individual will. It’s about learning to live in “the third age of eating”—defined by the overwhelming abundance of ultra-processed eating options—and arming yourself with the simple and not-so-simple facts that will help you make the choices that are right for you.</p>",

It’s already causing mini-waves in my own home as I frantically figure out what in the world to stock my cupboard with. In <i>Salt Sugar Fat</i> we meet the major players inside the processed food industry, as well as learning about all the things that they understand about human nature that the average person doesn’t. Quite simply, we are built to crave salt, sugar, and fat, and the big food companies make sure they deliver it cheaply and by the truckload. You’ll never view food - and your relationship with it - the same again. <a href=\"http://www.audible.com/review-by-author?customerID=AWP6QNKMRI86I\"><i> Emily, Audible Editor</i></a></p>",

A food industry whistleblower, to be precise.  And what he reveals is something many of us suspected, but is no less dramatically disturbing.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Basically the food industry is creating and adding extremely addictive chemicals to processed foods of all types, with the single intent to get you to buy more, eat more, and repeat ad nauseum.  Salt, sugar and fat additives are manipulated at the molecular level to cause the pleasure centers of the consumer's brain (the very same pleasure centers affected by heroin addicts) to dramatically respond to and become addicted to the taste of the grocery store foods you eat, causing you to again, buy more, eat more, thus fattening yourself as well the food industry's (and the health insurance industry's) sizable wallets.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>These additives are now causing a generation of pre-teen illnesses once only seen in the very elderly, and causing the soon to retire baby boomers to face illnesses that don't have to be endured.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>We have placed our trust in the food industry, quickly swallowing, literally, what we're told.  It's time to wake up, to realize that trust has been nightmarishly broken, and our very health and lives are in danger.  And the food industry couldn't care less.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>These reveals aren't speculation, but facts backed up by insider company documentation, with more discovered on a daily basis. The sheer amount of proven conclusions are stunning, and the result is a national disaster.  Moss was recently on the Oz show, among others, and is spreading the word.  It's sobering, and it's scary, to state it plainly.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>I can speak solidly on this audiobook's conclusions, having once weighed 390 pounds and endured a horrible physical lifestyle.  I began to do the research, and discovered much speculation regarding what Moss has now proven to be fact.  It disturbed me so much, that it changed my life, and I went on a strict program of healthier foods, additional water intake, and walking daily.  As the processed foods remains washed out of my body, I began to lose a dramatic amount of weight, my health returned, and I felt better than I had in a very long time.  I've kept the weight off, and enjoy my life immensely.  I'm living proof that these processed foods can damage you, and that it's not too late to change.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Dear Audible listener, note the star rating I've given this book.  VERY FEW of my reviews garnish such a positive recommendation.  I cannot help by make this my most highly recommended listen thus far for 2013.  And when you listen, I'm confident that you'll agree.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>I appreciate that you've taken the time to read this review.  Now, take the time to learn the truth about what you eat, and what it's doing to you.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Stop being the victim.",

The research that Michael Moss presents I found to be comprehensive and convincing. I hope parents take the time to listen to this and think of how to change the behaviors that \"convenience\" foods have instilled in the tastes of our kids. It is worth the time and the credit. Otherwise, we are out gunned in the fight. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>On a purely personal note, I find the narration slightly overly conspiratorial and breathless. But I got used to it after awhile.",

With this technology, they could make cheap, unnutritious foods taste good, and use the resulting high margins to fund advertising to drive demand. The food industry also made these foods more convenient than cooking. They even played a role in killing off home economics in the schools to ensure the next generation would not know how to cook.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Oh, one little side-effect that the industry needs to sweep under the rug: because these processed foods are so unlike foods found in nature, the body body can't properly gauge when these foods make the body full -- causing people to consume far more calories than they need. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Some interesting angles to the story are the involvement of the tobacco industry, such as Phillip Morris’s acquisition of food companies; and the healthy lifestyles pursued by the food industry executives, who eat their own products far more sparingly than the general public does.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>This is not rocket science, but it’s great investigative journalism. It may be the best investigative journalism about the food industry since Upton Sinclair's work a century ago about food impurities. Yes, that good; that important.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>One minor annoyance is that the narrator, Scott Brick, over dramatizes. Brick mostly narrates fiction, which he should probably stick to. He was perhaps chosen because he did an excellent narration of The Omnivore’s Dilemma (another great book for folks concerned about modern food), but that book was more of a memoir, making it a better fit with his narration style. Sugar, Salt, Fat is pure investigative journalism. The emotional level of Brick’s reading doesn’t fit with this genre. &lt;br/>",

Michael Moss reveals how companies use salt, sugar, and fat to addict us and, more important, how we can fight back. </p> <p>In the spring of 1999, the heads of the world’s largest processed food companies gathered at Pillsbury headquarters in Minneapolis for a secret meeting. On the agenda: the emerging epidemic of obesity, and what to do about it. </p> <p>Increasingly, the salt-, sugar-, and fat-laden foods these companies produced were being linked to obesity, and a concerned Kraft executive took the stage to issue a warning: There would be a day of reckoning unless changes were made. When he was done, the most powerful person in the room - the CEO of General Mills - stood up to speak, clearly annoyed. And by the time he sat down, the meeting was over. </p> <p>In <i>Salt Sugar Fat</i>, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Michael Moss shows how we got here. Featuring examples from some of the most recognizable (and profitable) companies and brands of the last half century - including Kraft, Coca-Cola, Lunchables, Kellogg, Nestlé, Oreos, Cargill, Capri Sun, and many more - Moss’ explosive, empowering narrative is grounded in meticulous, often eye-opening research. </p> <p>Includes a bonus PDF with endnotes from the book </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>",

                    "body": "Perhaps Max Barry might thinks that he has written a brilliant social commentary disguised as a crummy adventure story. It is actually the reverse -- a brilliant action adventure story masquerading as a clumsy social protest.\r<br />\r<br />The overall theme of the book is anti-capitalism. As a theme, I could take it or leave it. Max, however, doesn't execute this theme well. He relies exclusively on hyperbole to criticize. He offers no alternatives. All of the corporations are villain entities. Max seems to have a particular hate-on for the NRA because those characters are consistently both violent and incompetent.\r<br />\r<br />The title character is a very static character, well developed, and fun. Jennifer Government is an investigator who is trying to expose a conspiracy to kill innocents. Her big plot twist is a little predictable, but I still enjoyed how Max brought drove me to that twist in the road. Although a loner by nature, she succeeds in the end only by accepting help from others.\r<br />\r<br />The other lead, Hack Nike, is too dynamic. I don't mind that he experiences character growth, but his change is too sudden. His personality changes to the point of being unrecognizable, seemingly within two short scenes. Had he followed the Hero's Journey formula, I could have shrugged it off, but that simply isn't happening here.\r<br />\r<br />The most fun part for me was the allegoric style. It is an allegory, and almost a classical allegory like Everyman. Characters have metaphoric names like John Nike, Billy NRA, and the Pepsi Kid. My favorite character is the Pepsi Kid, an overly excitable young executive whose name no one can remember.\r<br />\r<br />The adventure takes a varied cast of characters around the globe and through four countries. The climatic action could have been over the proverbial top, but Max writes it with excellent balance of detail and pacing.\r<br />\r<br />Micheal Kramer's reading is great, curiously with an American accent for a Australian cast.\r<br />\r<br />Although problematic, I overall greatly enjoyed it.",

When lowly Merchandising Officer Hack Nike unwittingly signs a contract that involves shooting teenagers to build up street credibility for Nike's new line of $2,500 sneakers, he goes to The Police, only to be pursued by Jennifer Government, a tough-talking agent with a bar-code tattoo under her eye, the consumer watchdog from hell.",

Please disregard any reviews mentioning poor audio quality prior to December 2019.</b></p> <p>Why do some products capture our attention, while others flop? What makes us engage with certain products out of habit? Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us? This audiobook introduces listeners to the \"Hooked Model\", a four-step process companies use to build customer habits. Through consecutive cycles through the hook, successful products reach their ultimate goal of bringing users back repeatedly - without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.</p> <p><i>Hooked </i>is a guide to building products people use because they want to, not because they have to. Written for product managers, designers, marketers, startup founders, and people eager to learn more about the things that control our behaviors, this audiobook gives listeners:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Practical insights to create user habits that stick.</li> <li>Actionable steps for building products people love.</li> <li>Behavioral techniques used by Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and other habit-forming products.</li> <li><b>New </b>for second edition! An additional case study for building health habits.</li> </ul> <p>Nir Eyal distilled years of research, consulting, and practical experience to write a manual for creating habit-forming products. Nir has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Hasso Plattner Institute of Design. His writing on technology, psychology, and business appears in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>TechCrunch</i>, and <i>Psychology Today</i>.

            "publisher_summary": "<p>The utterly gripping story of the most outrageous case of cyber piracy prosecuted by the US Department of Justice. </p> <p>A former US Navy intelligence officer, David Locke Hall was a federal prosecutor when a bizarre-sounding website, CRACK99, came to his attention. It looked like Craigslist on acid, but what it sold was anything but amateurish: thousands of high-tech software products used largely by the military, and for mere pennies on the dollar. Want to purchase satellite tracking software? No problem. Aerospace and aviation simulations? No problem. Communications systems designs? No problem. Software for Marine One, the presidential helicopter? No problem. With delivery times and customer service to rival the world's most successful online retailers, anybody, anywhere - including rogue regimes, terrorists, and countries forbidden from doing business with the United States - had access to these goods for any purpose whatsoever. But who was behind CRACK99, and where were they? </p> <p>The Justice Department discouraged potentially costly, risky cases like this, preferring the low-hanging fruit that scored points from politicians and the public. But Hall and his colleagues were determined to find the culprit. They bought CRACK99's products for delivery in the United States, buying more and more to appeal to the budding entrepreneur in the man they identified as Xiang Li. After winning his confidence, they lured him to Saipan - a US commonwealth territory where Hall's own father had stormed the beaches with the marines during World War II. There, they set up an audacious sting that culminated in Xiang Li's capture and imprisonment. The value of the goods offered by CRACK99? A cool $100 million. </p> <p>An eye-opening look at cybercrime and its chilling consequences for national security, <i>CRACK99</i> is like a caper that resonates with every amazing detail. </p>",

An outspoken dissident in Donald Trump’s GOP, he has made headlines in recent years for standing alone against the forces he believes are poisoning the party he once led. Romney was the first senator in history to vote to remove from office a president of his own party. When that president’s supporters went on to storm the US Capitol, Romney delivered a thundering speech from the Senate floor accusing his fellow Republicans of stoking insurrection. Despite these moments of public courage, Romney has shared very little about what he’s witnessed behind the scenes over his three decades in politics—in GOP cloakrooms and caucus lunches, in his private meetings with Donald Trump and his family, in his dealings with John McCain, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, Joe Manchin, and Kyrsten Sinema. Now, exclusively for this biography, Romney has provided a window to his most private thoughts.<br /> <br /> Based on dozens of interviews with Romney, his family, and his inner circle as well as hundreds of pages of his personal journals and private emails, this in-depth portrait by award-winning journalist McKay Coppins shows a public servant authentically wrestling with the choices he has made over his career. In lively, revelatory detail, the book traces Romney’s early life and rise through the ranks of a fast-transforming Republican Party and exposes how a trail of seemingly small compromises by political leaders has led to a crisis in democracy. Ultimately<i>,</i> <i>Romney: A Reckoning</i> is a redemptive story about a flawed politician who summoned his moral courage just as fear and divisiveness were overtaking American life.</p>",

This reader changed my whole experience with the book. Moby Dick is, of course, a wonderful book, but the reader added a whole new dimension. He brought the characters to life, which gave me a whole new perspective on their personalities &#40;especially Ishmael&#41;. This perspective made the plot, subtext and interplay of the book so much more lively and exciting. Even the &quot;boring&quot; parts involving &quot;all you need to know about whaling.&quot; Thank you thank you thank you so much, dear reader. You have a great talent!",

This is a long book with parts that are not exactly high drama - so Hootkins' &quot;overacting&quot; is really good at pulling us through those long arcs. It is certainly the best Moby Dick audiobook out there. I would go out on a limb and say it's actually one of the best audiobooks I've ever heard &#40;my Audible library has over 300 books&#41;.

Nay, my friend. It was saucy, salty, and American.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The subject matter is absolutely riveting to the imagination. The deep inner thoughts of the characters are poetic and stirring. The manic, unresting, hungry intelligence of Ishmael illuminates a world I'd have never known existed, the intimate inner workings of an industry, and the beauty of the experiences had by men who might be dismissed as uneducated and rough. The stories are so spectacular, so grippingly entertaining, I'd often stop what I was doing while listening, hands stilled in their motions, and half smiling and wide eyed, waiting to hear what came next. And sometimes all I could say was, \"No, freaking, way.\"&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Treat yourself to Moby Dick.",

If that is what you are looking for too, Plunder is not the book for you.  Plunder is a borderline unhinged screed that seeks to overwhelm readers with facts, statistics and anecdotes about private equity without providing necessary context, which creates a highly misleading picture about the industry.  A few examples of the many issues with this work follow.  \r<br />\r<br />First, throughout the book the author treats the management company, its funds and the funds&rsquo; respective portfolio companies as being the same entity.  This is not the case.  They are distinct legal entities, which is why the management company is found not to be liable for the acts of its funds&rsquo; portfolio companies in the myriad of examples the author cites in the book as evidence of the evils of private equity.  This outcome is not extraordinary as the author would like to suggest or some magical treatment that PE sponsors benefit from.  The principle at work is the same one that prevents an individual who owns stock in a publicly traded company for being sued directly for the bad acts of the company absent certain extraordinary circumstances.  Takes a bit of the bite out of the argument when put in the appropriate context.  \r<br />\r<br />Second, the author repeatedly claims that PE sponsors are paying dividends, management fees and transaction fees without any limitation.  This is simply untrue and is indicative of the extremely shallow understanding of the industry that the author possesses.  The credit agreements for the acquisition debt place significant limitations on the payments of fees to the funds, including among others prohibiting the portfolio company from paying dividends unless certain performance targets are satisfied or blocking the payment of the management fee if the borrower is in default under the credit agreement.  Further, the LP side letters that govern the relationship between the fund and its investors routinely include prohibitions on the payment of certain fees and increasingly require funds to share or rebate a percentage of certain fees to the limited partners in the fund.  As such, sponsors are not able to pay dividends, management fees, success fees, etc. without any limit as the author repeatedly claims. \r<br />\r<br />Lastly, throughout the work the author refers to bankruptcy proceedings involving the portfolio companies of a specific sponsor in an effort to suggest such sponsor and the industry more generally utilize the bankruptcy system in an abusive manner.  What the author conveniently omits to tell his readers is that such sponsor's strategy is to invest in distressed companies, i.e. companies that are already in bankruptcy or on the verge of bankruptcy.  As such, the fact that its portfolio companies are routinely involved in bankruptcy proceedings is far from a surprise; however, the author is either so unversed in the industry that he purports to be an expert in or so disingenuous that he knowingly omits this fact in an effort to craft his narrative about the evils of the private equity industry.  \r<br />\r<br />The private equity industry has its excesses and abuses, but this book works way too hard at trying to paint the industry as being utterly without redeeming value, which is simply not the case.  \r<br />",

Though I share much of the author's critique and policy interests, I wish the book had more high level political and economic context. There's plenty of history, to be sure, but it seems aimed at gotchas about the voting records of specific politicians rather than discussing the sometimes very reasonable choices the American electorate and leaders made that had unintended side effects. Here, we get the side effects without the counterweight of many of the positive primary effects of policy initiatives. Still a good read on an issue of rapidly growing importance.",

Plunder is the right word, as Brendan Ballou lucidly explains in his infuriating, illuminating, essential book. And his practical plan for reining in this monstrous new centerpiece of our system makes total sense.”—<i><b>Kurt Andersen, author of Evil Geniuses: The Unmaking of America</b></i>",

Ballou shows how these modern-day robber barons not only target the poor and serve themselves, but also bore into the foundations of our economy and society, weakening it for everyone. He ends with a stirring roadmap for reform.”<br /> —<i><b>Jesse Eisinger, ProPublica, author of The Chickenshit Club: Why the Justice Department Fails to Prosecute Executives</b></i>",

In <i>Plunder</i>, Ballou tells a complicated story clearly and explains how private equity shapes your life and importantly, how it can be stopped. For anyone who wants to understand why our economy has become so broken and so unjust—and for anyone who wants to fix it—<i>Plunder</i> is required reading.”—<i><b>Zephyr Teachout, professor of law, Fordham Law School, and author of Break 'em Up: Recovering our Freedom from Big Ag, Big Tech, and Big Money</b></i>"

Yet few understand what these firms are or how they work.</p> <p>In <i>Plunder</i>, Brendan Ballou explains how private equity has reshaped American business by raising prices, reducing quality, cutting jobs, and shifting resources from productive to unproductive parts of the economy. Ballou vividly illustrates how many private equity firms buy up retailers, medical practices, prison services, nursing-home chains, and mobile-home parks, among other businesses, using little of their own money to do it and avoiding debt and liability for their actions. Forced to take on huge debts and pay extractive fees, companies purchased by private equity firms are often left bankrupt, or shells of their former selves, with consequences to communities that long depended on them.</p> <p>Perhaps most startling is Ballou’s insight into how this is happening with the active support of various arms of the government. But, as Ballou reveals in an agenda for reigning in the industry, private equity can be stopped from wreaking further havoc.</p>",

                    "body": "I read Why Nations Fail this month while traveling in South Korea. The book was much on my mind as I looked across the DMZ at North Korea on the 38th parallel. South Korea, a country of about 50 million people, enjoys a per capital PPP (purchasing power parity) GDP of around $32,000. (The U.S. is $48,000 by comparison - wealthier but also with a less equally distributed income). In North Korea, the GDP per capita (PPP) is $2,400 - an incredibly low numbers that still probably understates how desperately poor (and hungry) are the people of North Korea.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Why should North Korea be so poor, and South Korea so rich?&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The two countries share common cultural roots, geography, and access to natural resources. This is the question Acemoglu and Robinson attempt to answer in Why Nations Fail. They look at examples such as North Korea, as well as other natural experiments of societies that share similar exogenous traits (resources, climate, etc.) - such as the twin Nogales's in Mexico and Arizona.   &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Acemoglu and Robinson's explanation as to why some nations are poor and others rich has everything to do with the elites. Poor nations are poor because the people who run these countries have made their subjects destitute in service of enriching themselves. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>North Korea can best be understood as being run by a criminal family. Mexico is so much poorer than the U.S. because of its history of being run by elites whose main goal was to extract wealth, and who did not need to redistribute economic production as for most of its history the country lacked pluralistic institutions that could check the power of the rulers.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>This argument, that some countries are poor because the powerful keep them poor, stands in direct opposition to the arguments that Jared Diamond makes in Guns, Germs and Steel. Diamond believes that the wealth distribution was largely pre-determined by immunity to disease (or lack thereof), access to domesticable livestock, and the raw materials and technologies to make advanced weapons.   &lt;br/>&lt;br/>I am a huge fan of Diamond's writing, but Why Nations Fail has me thoroughly convinced that more deterministic view of development (as put forward by Diamond and others) is problematic. Why Nations Fail should definitely be on the syllabus in any economic history or development course, and on the bookshelf (physical or virtual) of anyone interested in global inequality, poverty, and why some nations are so much richer than others.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Should you invest the time to read Why Nations Fail? The book is 544 pages, or almost 18 hours by audiobook (my reading choice). Acemoglu and Robinson would have benefited from a strong-willed editor, one who was willing to push them to provide less historical detail (the book has a ton from around the world across numerous societies), and more analysis of the implications of their arguments for countries like China and India.   &lt;br/>&lt;br/>I came away from Why Nations Fail thinking that if the argument is correct then China's long-term economic prospects might not be as good as we assume, and India's may be better.  But having spent time time in South Korea, which developed so rapidly at least partly under a repressive military regime, it is hard to square this conclusion with the recent facts of some of our fastest developing countries.  &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Perhaps Acemoglu and Robinson next book will take outliers and implications, building on top of the theoretical foundations for development and inequality laid out in Why Nations Fail.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;br/>",

                    "body": "Acemoglu and Robinson’s central thesis isn’t hard to understand: countries with inclusive, equitable political and economic institutions tend to prosper, while those with extractive, exclusive institutions geared towards the interests of a small elite tend to languish. The authors minimize geography and culture as significant factors in the equation, pointing to nations where those realities are similar but political systems vary.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The dynamic exists, the authors maintain, because the interests of an exploitative elite and those of regular citizens are usually in conflict, so the elite must actively block democratic movements, workers rights, unions, property rights, innovation, etc. in order to maintain a hold on power. In more inclusive systems, meanwhile, there is a virtuous circle effect, in which opportunity breeds motivation and meaningful choice, while making it hard for anyone to consolidate too much power over others.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>It’s a strikingly simple hypothesis -- a little too simple, I think -- but the authors back it up with a wide set of historical cases, ranging from post-Renaissance Europe, to the colonial Americas (noting the different approaches taken by English and Spanish settlers in controlling their territories), to post 17th century Britain, to the United States (monopolies and trusts are discussed), to the Arab world, to the Soviet Union, to modern Africa, to North versus South Korea. Even if you more or less accept the book’s ideas, the details are still informative. If you’re not familiar with the political differences between imperial Spain and England, they cast quite a bit of light on the separate paths taken by the two former world powers -- and their former colonial possessions. Similarly, you don’t appreciate what apartheid meant for South Africa until you’ve contemplated just how the system was structured to impede blacks from becoming more than cheap sources of labor. As was a problem in the US, too.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The examinations seemed politically balanced. Communist governments taking a drubbing, and the authors argue that China’s rapid growth as orchestrated by Bejiing is unlikely to be sustainable unless the Party relinquishes more of its grip. But Acemoglu and Robinson also pay attention to how capitalist monopolies undermine democratic ideals, as do weak or corrupt central governments that lack the power to enforce laws and protect individual rights.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The book has its blind spots, though. I simply don’t agree with the authors that geography doesn’t matter. Most wealthy countries, it seems to me, have inclusive systems, but were also blessed in resources, either obtained locally, or extracted from some other region. It’s easy, for example, to see a country like the Netherlands as owing its prosperity to being a liberal democracy, but that’s not the whole story. The Netherlands got started on a path to prosperity because it set up exploitative trading companies during the colonial era and eventually reallocated the wealth into new ventures. I also think that geopolitics is underrepresented as a factor. South Korea and Israel might be successful countries in spite of tough landscapes, but both enjoyed massive military and economic support from the United States, enabling technological economies to flourish. It’s not that a country like Zimbabwe has no chance of becoming a technology center, but it would have to find a way to produce skilled workers who can compete in the global economy, without being tempted to emigrate.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>All in all, the ideas that Acemoglu and Robinson promote are important foundational ones, but should be considered with their blind spots taken into account. Readers interested in history for its own sake might enjoy the case studies; if not, the themes are pretty repetitive.",

                    "body": "I am absolutely shocked at the positive reviews this book has gotten, both from people on this site and from professional economists. At its core, this book is nothing but a hodgepodge of just-so stories: every nation that succeeds had something right in its institutions, and every one that failed had something wrong. While there's undoubtedly some truth to this, the authors give very little criteria for determining just what good institutions are, or advice for how they can be fostered. Oftentimes, when economists invade and colonize other disciplines, great things can happen (think education theory); but in this case it's clear to me that two economists (not even economic historians) tried to take on what is really straight-up history, and did a rather terrible job of it. (What on Earth is the story of Pocahontus doing in this book? And the part on the ancient Maya is a joke.) Again, I think there's undoubtedly some truth to the broad *institutionalist* school of development theory. But (one of) the big criticism(s) of the institutionalists is that it's all buzz words, and when things go right credit good institutions, and when things go wrong they blame bad institutions, and they have no concrete understanding of what elements of a nation's institutions matter, or advice for what to do to improve things. A&R do nothing to dispel these criticisms.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Alternative books that cover some of the same ground: If you're interested in development, I recommend \"Poor Economics\". If you want *big history*, I recommend \"Why the West Rules for Now\". If you just want cool stories about the colonial period, which is a lot of what A&R spend their 18-hour book on, check out Landes' \"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations\", strangely not available in audio. I'd like to recommend something on the institutions v. geography, etc. debates that have eaten up development economics, but honestly I don't think there's a good intellectual history out there, and this is definitely not it. I'd say William Easterly (\"White Man's Burden\") does a little better job at making the thesis relevant, but I'm not a huge fan of him either. And I can't really recommend anyone actually read Jeffrey Sachs. The first chapter in \"Poor Economics\" goes over things a little. ",

Perhaps ignorance of what the right policies are? </p> <p>Simply, no. None of these factors is either definitive or destiny. Otherwise, how to explain why Botswana has become one of the fastest growing countries in the world, while other African nations, such as Zimbabwe, the Congo, and Sierra Leone, are mired in poverty and violence? </p> <p>Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson conclusively show that it is man-made political and economic institutions that underlie economic success (or lack of it). Korea, to take just one of their fascinating examples, is a remarkably homogeneous nation, yet the people of North Korea are among the poorest on earth while their brothers and sisters in South Korea are among the richest. The south forged a society that created incentives, rewarded innovation, and allowed everyone to participate in economic opportunities. The economic success thus spurred was sustained because the government became accountable and responsive to citizens and the great mass of people. Sadly, the people of the north have endured decades of famine, political repression, and very different economic institutions - with no end in sight. The differences between the Koreas is due to the politics that created these completely different institutional trajectories. </p> <p>Based on 15 years of original research Acemoglu and Robinson marshall extraordinary historical evidence from the Roman Empire, the Mayan city-states, medieval Venice, the Soviet Union, Latin America, England, Europe, the United States, and Africa to build a new theory of political economy with great relevance for the big questions of today, including: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>China has built an authoritarian growth machine. Will it continue to grow at such high speed and overwhelm the West?</li> <li>Are America’s best days behind it? Are we moving from a virtuous circle in which efforts by elites to aggrandize power are resisted to a vicious one that enriches and empowers a small minority?</li> <li>What is the most effective way to help move billions of people from the rut of poverty to prosperity? More philanthropy from the wealthy nations of the West? Or learning the hard-won lessons of Acemoglu and Robinson’s breakthrough ideas on the interplay between inclusive political and economic institutions? </li> </ul> <p><i>Why Nations Fail</i> will change the way you look at—and understand—the world.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>",

First, there is nothing really new here.  Tracy makes many of the same points in several programs his has authored.  He even tells one story that I first heard from him on a cassette (yes, cassette) series I purchased in 1997.  Second, the book is not really about personal disciple.  That is just a lead to connect topics he covers better in other programs – goal setting, time management, sales.  Third, the audio quality is sub standard.  Not to the point of distraction.  But, for a person of his stature you would expect better.  I am still a fan.  But, would suggest you skip this offering.  ",

It's very fast moving and the ideas are very well organized. I did not buy this book to find a never-before-heard of secret to self-discipline and so hearing familiar thoughts and ideas was in no way a disappointment to me. Rather I'd hoped to find motivational encouragement to put into practice those ideas I know to be true about achieving greatness in life and this book absolutely delivers! I'll definitely be listening to this book many more times. I honestly find myself already doing hard things that I would rather procrastinate and that is the motivation I hoped to find in this book. Two thumbs up!",

Brian Tracy knows this firsthand. He didn’t graduate from high school, and after working for a few years as a laborer, he realized he had limited skills and a limited future. But through the power of self-discipline, he changed his life, achieving success in sales and marketing, investing, real-estate development, and management consulting. He has consulted to more than 1,000 companies, given motivational speeches and seminars to more than four million people in 40 countries, and written 45 books.</p> <p><i>No Excuses!</i> shows you how you can achieve success in all three major areas of your life:</p> <ul> <li>Your personal goals: self-discipline can help you realize that you are responsible for your success and shows you how persistence really does pay off.</li> <li>Your business and money goals: self-discipline can make you a better leader and a better manager, help you close more sales and make more money, improve your time-management and problem- solving abilities, and make you more effective and successful at work.</li> <li>Your overall happiness: self-discipline can help you be happier, healthier, and more physically fit, and it can help you in your marriage and your relationships with your children and friends.</li> </ul> <p>Each of the 21 chapters in this audiobook shows you how to be more disciplined in one aspect of your life, with end- of-chapter exercises to help you apply the “no excuses” approach to your own life. With these guidelines, you can learn how to be more successful in everything you do—instead of wistfully envying others who you think are just “luckier” than you. A little self-discipline goes a long way...so stop making excuses and listen to this audiobook!</p>",

However, to say that government planning could work since private sector planning works seems like a false equivalence. Also I do not think that the author made a very compelling argument in defense of the Soviet model. I don't think the authors reasons successfully explain away why the Soviet system failed. This is a compelling attempt to rehabilitate economic planning in the wake of the failures of Soviet socialism. Compelling but not convincing.  Nonetheless, I would recommend anybody interested in economic theory especially someone open to hearing opposing views read this book.",

Their remarkable success appears to vindicate the old idea that modern society is too complex to be subjected to a plan. And yet, as Leigh Phillips and Michal Rozworski argue, much of the economy of the West is centrally planned at present. Not only is planning on vast scales possible, we already have it and it works. The real question is whether planning can be democratic. Can it be transformed to work for us?</p> <p>An engaging, polemical romp through economic theory, computational complexity, and the history of planning, <i>The People's Republic of Walmart </i>revives the conversation about how society can extend democratic decision-making to all economic matters. With the advances in information technology in recent decades and the emergence of globe-straddling collective enterprises, democratic planning in the interest of all humanity is more important and closer to attainment than ever before.</p>",

But in this insightful and inspiring new audiobook, he looks beyond traditional measures of wealth to explore how a rich life is one of significance, not just financial success. </p> <p>As Green observes, money creates wealth, but so do character, conscience, attitude, and wisdom. Only by incorporating each of these elements into your day-to-day existence can you experience what the ancients called \"the good life.\" </p> <p>A generous, wide-ranging inquiry into what matters most, <i>Beyond Wealth</i> is a road map to a rich life, to what the author calls \"True Wealth.\" </p> <p>The book contains more than sixty-five commentaries on topics ranging from love, health, leisure, honor, courage, trust, philosophy, history, science, and spirituality. And the author's perspective on each subject is broadened and deepened by liberal quotations from Shakespeare, Thoreau, Emerson, Gandhi, Einstein, Tolstoy, and other great minds. </p> <p><i>Beyond Wealth</i> is full of practical wisdom. Yet it is also a book of contemplations, promoting both greater understanding and deep reflection. Each piece can be read alone and is characterized by brevity, wit, and a liveliness of mind that recalls the best of Montaigne and Swift. </p> <p>Combining personal anecdotes with provocative insights and timeless truths, <i>Beyond Wealth</i> is a fascinating exploration of the unique intersection between money, personal fulfillment, and successful living.</p>",

No, The Art of War is just pithy, and was never intended to be a book.  It was written down on scrolls around 500 BC.  A translation of the text itself will be no more than 80 pages, often in the form of verse or bullet points, though a given edition might be longer because it contains additional material, such as an introduction and some of the classical commentary.  For example, Lionel Giles' translation is 25 pages long and just under 11,000 words.\r<br />\r<br />As for the text speaking of Master Sun saying various things, that's not an uncommon device. The Book of Ecclesiastes does it, too, for example, and so does the Chuang Tzu.  &quot;Sun Tzu&quot; appears to be an imaginary authority, inspired by a military expert named Sun Bin, rather than the actual author, so it's pretty logical. \r<br />\r<br />I mention this because at least a couple of the commenters here have come to the wrong conclusions about what this audio book is, and a lot of people have taken their word for it, judging by the approval ratings.  This is a very good recording, and it would be a shame to overlook it because of a misunderstanding.",

If you’ve ever been interested in this text, go for it.<br /><br />If you’re reading this review, my guess is that you’re wondering about the performance. In short, Aidan Gillen knocks it out of the park. If you’re a fan of Aidan Gillen (or Game of Thrones in general) what could be cooler than being schooled in the art of war by Lord Petyr Baelish himself? You owe it to yourself to give this a listen. Highly recommended!",

In spite of its battlefield specificity, <i>The Art of War</i> has found new life in the modern age, with leaders in fields as wide and far-reaching as world politics, human psychology, and corporate strategy finding valuable insight in its timeworn words. </p> <p>Aidan Gillen - who has learned a thing or two about strategy through his roles as skilled manipulator Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish (<i>Game of Thrones</i>) and ambitious politician Tommy Carcetti (<i>The Wire</i>) - brilliantly performs this ancient classic. His experience in portraying insightful and, at times, cunning characters makes him a natural fit for this ancient collection of battlefield epigrams whose influence has grown tremendously in the modern world.</p>",

He keeps talking about his jobs and thoughts and aspirations and quitting job X and getting job Y in unbearable detail. He should've explicitly stated the exact point of each chapter, lessons learned, advice he gives us, instead all we get is chapter after chapter of him between great jobs and not being happy about it, ok, so what is it that you're trying to say exactly? I'm sure there are lessons there but the author is unable to articulate them early and clearly. \r<br />\r<br />Second problem: just because you can narrate your own book, doesn't mean you should. Author's voice is not good or strong enough to narrate an audiobook, he should've left this to the professional narrators. \r<br />\r<br />Overall a painful experience and a book that should've simply been published as a short article.",

From a small-town Connecticut kid to the most prestigious consulting firm in the world, he had everything he thought he wanted. Yet he decided to walk away and embark on the \"real work\" of his life - finding the things that matter and daring to create a life to make them happen.</p> <p>This Pathless Path is about finding yourself in the wrong life, and the real work of figuring out how to live. Through painstaking experiments, living in different countries and the goodwill of people from around the world, Paul pieces together a set of ideas and principles that guide him from unfulfilled and burned out to the good life and all of the existential crises in between.</p> <p><i>The Pathless Path</i> is not a how-to book filled with “hacks”; instead, it is a vulnerable account of Paul’s journey from leaving a path centered around getting ahead and towards another, one focused on doing work that matters. This book is an ideal companion for people considering leaving their jobs, embarking on a new path, dealing with the uncertainty of an unconventional path, or searching for better models for thinking about work in a fast-changing world.</p>",

I currently earn an above average income (low 6 figures). Even though I can afford a good living, I feel like saving through my 401k is not getting me anywhere fast. As a former financial advisor, I believe the author's ideas are sound and he confirms why I felt like a fraud every time I pitched stocks and mutual funds. While it has been done, it is extremely difficult to make big gains in the stock market. It's mainly a really slow game that takes more than a couple decades to work. This book presents a mental state rather than a step by step plan. The author gives many examples of fast track success stories and most importantly, he doesn't sell any of the content as \"get rich easy\". Oh, and there's no up selling attempts within this book!

That plan sounds a little something like this: </p> <p>\"Graduate from college, get a good job, save 10% of your paycheck, buy a used car, cancel the movie channels, quit drinking expensive Starbucks mocha lattes, save and penny-pinch your life away, trust your life-savings to the stock market, and one day, when you are oh, say, 65 years old, you can retire rich.\" </p> <p>Since you were old enough to hold a job, you've been hoodwinked to believe that wealth can be created by blindly trusting in the uncontrollable and unpredictable markets: the housing market, the stock market, and the job market. I call this soul-sucking, dream-stealing dogma \"The Slowlane\" - an impotent financial gamble that dubiously promises wealth in a wheelchair. </p> <p>Accept the Slowlane as your financial roadmap and your financial future will blow carelessly asunder on a sailboat of hope: hope you can get a job and keep it, hope the stock market doesn't tank, hope the economy rebounds, hope, hope, and hope. Do you really want hope to be the centerpiece of your family's financial plan? </p> <p>Drive the Slowlane road and you will find your life deteriorate into a miserable exhibition about what you cannot do, versus what you can. For those who don't want a lifetime subscription to \"settle-for-less\", there is an alternative; an expressway to extraordinary wealth capable of burning a trail to financial independence faster than any road out there. And shockingly, this road has nothing to do with jobs, 401(k), mutual funds, or a lifestyle of mediocrity. </p> <p>Demand more. Change lanes and find your explosive wealth accelerator. Hit the Fastlane, crack the code to wealth, and find out how to live rich for a lifetime. </p>",

If you are a man this book won't help you much in terms of landing a date. All of the advice for getting dates from apps and websites are things I have found from some quick googling.. I think there should have been a bit more detail in and/or content for landing dates and less assumption that everyone has too many dating options. Most women on dating sites have a surplus of choices but I don't know many guys that do, including myself. I also think that there was too much content covering breakups. The relationship advice and practices are golden and the oratory performance is perfect. I think that if everyone used this book the divorce rate would be nearly non-existent in western society. I am very glad I listened to the whole thing. ",

Great relationships don’t just appear in our lives - they’re the culmination of a series of decisions, including whom to date, how to end it with the wrong person, and when to commit to the right one. But our brains often get in the way. We make poor decisions, which thwart us on our quest to find lasting love.</p> <p>Drawing from years of research, behavioral scientist turned dating coach Logan Ury reveals the hidden forces that cause those mistakes. But awareness on its own doesn’t lead to results. You have to actually change your behavior. Ury shows you how.</p> <p>This “simple-to-use guide” (Lori Gottlieb, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Maybe You Should Talk to Someone</i>) focuses on a different decision in each chapter, incorporating insights from behavioral science, original research, and real-life stories. You’ll learn:</p> <ul> <li>What’s holding you back in dating (and how to break the pattern)</li> <li>What really matters in a long-term partner (and what really doesn’t)</li> <li>How to overcome the perils of online dating (and make the apps work for you)</li> <li>How to meet more people in real life (while doing activities you love)</li> <li>How to make dates fun again (so they stop feeling like job interviews)</li> <li>Why “the spark” is a myth (but you’ll find love anyway)</li> </ul> <p>This “data-driven” (<i>Time</i>), step-by-step guide to relationships, complete with hands-on exercises, is designed to transform your life. <i>How to Not Die Alone </i>will help you find, build, and keep the relationship of your dreams.</p> <p>Please note: This is an historical recording. The audio quality represents the technology of the time when it was produced.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>",

It was inspiring to hear stories from others who have found great success starting out the same way I have.  It reinforces the 'Follow your passion\" stream of thought as well. &lt;br/>That said, the narration made it a less than stellar listen.  To me it sounded almost like a computerized voice, lacking the very passion the book was talking about. I could only listen in short time periods before the robotic voice started blending into the background and I realized I had missed large chunks of the story he was telling.  ",

Rather, he has a special genius for turning ideas into income, and he uses what he earns both to support his life of adventure and to give back. </p> <p>There are many others like Chris - those who've found ways to opt out of traditional employment and create the time and income to pursue what they find meaningful. Sometimes, achieving that perfect blend of passion and income doesn't depend on shelving what you currently do. You can start small with your venture, committing little time or money, and wait to take the real plunge when you're sure it's successful. </p> <p>In preparing to write this book, Chris identified 1,500 individuals who have built businesses earning $50,000 or more from a modest investment (in many cases, $100 or less), and from that group he’s chosen to focus on the 50 most intriguing case studies. In nearly all cases, people with no special skills discovered aspects of their personal passions that could be monetized, and were able to restructure their lives in ways that gave them greater freedom and fulfillment. </p> <p>Here, finally, distilled into one easy-to-use guide, are the most valuable lessons from those who’ve learned how to turn what they do into a gateway to self-fulfillment. It’s all about finding the intersection between your \"expertise\" - even if you don’t consider it such - and what other people will pay for. You don’t need an MBA, a business plan or even employees. All you need is a product or service that springs from what you love to do anyway, people willing to pay, and a way to get paid. </p> <p>Not content to talk in generalities, Chris tells you exactly how many dollars his group of unexpected entrepreneurs required to get their projects up and running; what these individuals did in the first weeks and months to generate significant cash; some of the key mistakes they made along the way, and the crucial insights that made the business stick. Among Chris’s key principles: if you’re good at one thing, you’re probably good at something else; never teach a man to fish - sell him the fish instead; and in the battle between planning and action, action wins. </p> <p>In ancient times, people who were dissatisfied with their lives dreamed of finding magic lamps, buried treasure, or streets paved with gold. Today, we know that it’s up to us to change our lives. And the best part is, if we change our own life, we can help others change theirs. This remarkable book will start you on your way.</p>",

I bought this book expecting practical advices on how to add humor into my day-to-day life, especially at work. Written by professors from a prestigious university, this book did not deliver what it seems to promise. Despite the reading performance was on spot most of the time, the content is simply written for an exclusive audience, not the general public. Here’s why:<br />- The first few chapters attempt to explain at length why humor is important and it really works if you play it right. It may seem to be a natural opening but the whole time I was listening, I was wondering does the author think the readers are completely ignorant about the importance of humor? If they bought the book, it’s because they already believe in the concept. You already have their buy-in. Repeating again and again how useful humor can be does not add true value to your readers. <br />- After the initial chapters, the writers seems to be very zoomed in the world of senior executives and CEOs. Most of the examples illustrated how adding humor to your leadership will make you a better leader. It might be valuable to people who already has the prestige in their environment to struck random humor in front of people they manage. After all, would you call out or really laugh at your CEO if he makes a bad joke? Of course not. Another example show cased an employee’s call back jokes with her manager. What struck me that the authors failed to acknowledge that of the manager and that employee already has a relationship to talk about her hair style comfortably, it lowers the bar of trying to be funny significantly. Context matters! <br />- Most (not all) theories these examples only apply in a vacuum, where the dynamic is already set up or the report is already built. You are naturally at the place to be funny because you have the psychological safety. Most people who work in a flat (aka not funny) environment, not Google, not Apple, not Slack, the breakthrough is building that psychological safety in a team, not thinking about what joke you can tell. <br />- Many of the conclusions and arguments and the joke attempts are quite forced. Maybe it’s because my lack of humor, which explains why I’m after this book. Just not inspired. <br />",

Pink, number-one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>When</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Drive</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>We are living through a period of unprecedented uncertainty and upheaval in both our personal and professional lives. So it should come as a surprise to exactly no one that trust, human connection, and mental well-being are all on the decline.</p> <p>This may seem like no laughing matter. Yet, the research shows that humor and laughter are among the most valuable tools we have at our disposal for strengthening bonds and relationships, diffusing stress and tension, boosting resilience, and performing when the stakes are high. </p> <p>That’s why Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas teach the popular course Humor: Serious Business at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where they help some of the world’s most hard-driving, blazer-wearing business minds infuse more humor and levity into their work and lives.</p> <p>In <i>Humor, Seriously,</i> they draw on findings by behavioral scientists, world-class comedians, and inspiring business leaders to reveal how humor works and - more important - how you can use more of it, better.</p> <p>Aaker and Bagdonas unpack the theory and application of humor: what makes something funny, how to mine your life for material, and simple ways to identify and leverage your unique humor style. They show how to use humor to rebuild vital connections; appear more confident, competent, and authentic at work; and foster cultures where levity and creativity can thrive.</p> <p>President Dwight David Eisenhower once said, “A sense of humor is part of the art of leadership, of getting along with people, of getting things done.” If Dwight David Eisenhower, the second least naturally funny president (after Franklin Pierce), thought humor was necessary to win wars, build highways, and warn against the military-industrial complex, then you might consider learning it too.</p>",

Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about US strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating <i>Deepwater Horizon</i> blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune’s Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden.</p> <p><i>A Promised Land</i> is extraordinarily intimate and introspective - the story of one man’s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of “hope and change”, and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible.</p> <p>This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama’s conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day.</p>",

Reaching the pinnacle of his profession, he became the FBI's lead international kidnapping negotiator. </p> <p><i>Never Split the Difference</i> takes you inside the world of high-stakes negotiations and into Voss' head, revealing the skills that helped him and his colleagues succeed where it mattered most: in saving lives. In this practical guide, he shares the nine effective principles - counterintuitive tactics and strategies - you, too, can use to become more persuasive in both your professional and personal lives. </p> <p>Life is a series of negotiations you should be prepared for: buying a car, negotiating a salary, buying a home, renegotiating rent, deliberating with your partner. Taking emotional intelligence and intuition to the next level, <i>Never Split the Difference</i> gives you the competitive edge in any discussion. </p>",

I&rsquo;ve seen Amanda Montell&rsquo;s previous book Wordslut and have considered getting it quite a few times, but now I&rsquo;m definitely going to read it now that I&rsquo;ve finished Cultish. If you&rsquo;re interested in understanding cults, how people get lured in, and how people get out, this books for you. If you enjoy the psychological aspect of cults, this book is for you. And if you want a completely unique perspective on cults, this book is also for you. I read hundreds of books each year, and many of them are in the realm of psychology, and it was so refreshing to read this book where the author focuses on how the language used can indoctrinate people and suck them into cult-like organizations. \r<br />\r<br />Unlike other books, Cultish covers the full gambit of cults, and what I really respected is how Montell puts cults on a sort of spectrum. The author explains the title for the book and how the word &ldquo;cult&rdquo; is often thrown around all willy nilly, so she started using the term &ldquo;cultish&rdquo;. Montell covers cults we&rsquo;re all familiar with like Heaven&rsquo;s Gate, the Branch Davidians, and Jonestown, but she also writes about many other groups that are &ldquo;cultish&rdquo;. Aside from touching on Scientology and some religious organizations, she also dives into how fitness groups like CrossFit and Pelaton can be cultish, and she also discusses the extremely important subject of social media cult followings. \r<br />\r<br />I have no criticisms of this book. Amanda is an incredible writer, and I can&rsquo;t wait to read her other book. I guess my only complaint is that she doesn&rsquo;t have more books for me to binge. As someone who is 9 years sober and got sober through 12-step programs like AA, it would have been interesting to hear her dive into that topic a bit more because she said that it&rsquo;s one of the reasons it inspired her book. But, if she ends up coming on The Rewired Soul podcast where I interview authors, I&rsquo;ll be able to ask her then. \r<br />",

What makes them powerful? The reason why so many of us binge Manson documentaries by the dozen and fall down rabbit holes researching suburban moms gone QAnon is because we’re looking for a satisfying explanation for what causes people to join - and more importantly, stay in - extreme groups. We secretly want to know: could it happen to me? Amanda Montell’s argument is that, on some level, it already has....</p> <p>Our culture tends to provide pretty flimsy answers to questions of cult influence, mostly having to do with vague talk of “brainwashing”. But the true answer has nothing to do with freaky mind-control wizardry or Kool-Aid. In <i>Cultish</i>, Montell argues that the key to manufacturing intense ideology, community, and us/them attitudes all comes down to language. In both positive ways and shadowy ones, cultish language is something we hear - and are influenced by - every single day. </p> <p>Through juicy storytelling and cutting original research, Montell exposes the verbal elements that make a wide spectrum of communities “cultish”, revealing how they affect followers of groups as notorious as Heaven’s Gate, but also how they pervade our modern start-ups, Peloton leaderboards, and Instagram feeds. Incisive and darkly funny, this enrapturing take on the curious social science of power and belief will make you hear the fanatical language of “cultish” everywhere.</p>",

Being a depressed, lonely, 12 year old child I came across this book by accident at my local library. I was searching the computer's library catalog: &quot;how to get friends&quot;, and this was the book that came up. Little did I know this book was going to become an essential for me in developing my social skills.\r<br />\r<br />At first glance, you may read the principles taught in this book and go: &quot;this is just common sense&quot;. But you may also have heard the quote &quot;common sense isn't common&quot;. How many of us actively make an effort to genuinely smile and be empathetic towards others? How may of us jump to criticizing others without considering the other person's point of view? How many of us condemn others without remembering it won't make the other person change their mind?\r<br />\r<br />I've read this book so many times I've lost count! It really changed my life, and I was so excited to see it be re-released for a new generation!\r<br />\r<br />That said, the book edition of my youth was from the 1990's. How does this new 2022 edition hold up? I compared the 2 side-by-side.\r<br />\r<br />PROS:\r<br />📌 Grammar revisions make the book easier to read. Examples include removal of filler words, word substitutions, and rewriting story examples. The changes are minor, so most of the time they are not very noticeable.\r<br />📌 A few new story examples have been added, featuring female figures like Evangeline Booth and Alice Foote MacDougall.\r<br />📌 A new concluding section: &quot;Apply the Dale Carnegie Principles After the Book&quot;\r<br />\r<br />CONS:\r<br />📌 Lots of book edits come off less as necessary and more as attempts to be politically correct, to remove anything that could be seen as problematic. Examples include substituting words (&quot;they&quot; for &quot;him&quot;, &quot;not be able to walk&quot; for &quot;cripple&quot;, &quot;house staff&quot; for &quot;servants&quot;) and stories that were needlessly removed (which leads to my next point).\r<br />📌 SO MANY story examples have been removed; no joke, I counted over 35! So many vivid examples that made the book so memorable for me as a kid, PC or not, are gone! I don't care if the story examples used Confederate general Robert E. Lee; they still illustrated the principles.\r<br />📌 Some edits just don't make sense at all. For example, they renamed Part 3, Chapter 5 from &quot;The Secret of Socrates&quot; to the principle &quot;Get the Other Person Saying 'Yes, Yes' Immediately&quot;. No other chapter was renamed like this, and the Socrates example is still in the chapter.\r<br />\r<br />As for the audiobook, the narrator gives a great presentation with a good range. But will his voice ever match the baritone of the original Andrew MacMillan? Unfortunately no.\r<br />\r<br />In sum, for those who are new to reading this book or were born past the 2000's, I'd say this 2022 edition is a nice introduction, albeit a very sanitized one. There's a longer and better version out there. But if you're already a fan of the 90's publication and could care less about political correctness, there's not much new here to justify a second purchase. In fact, there's much less!\r<br />\r<br />Sadly, this isn't the only book lately that's getting the Orwellian treatment. Other authors whose books have been altered lately for offensive content include Roald Dahl, Ian Fleming, Agatha Christie, and R.L. Stine (not to mention he's still alive and did not approve the changes). Simply put, it's really getting out of hand!\r<br />\r<br />Consider me an old fashioned 30 year old Millennial, but I'll be sticking with my original copy.",

The big problem with it is the false advertising in the description, which obviously is still identical to the one used for the hardcopy book. Many of the key topics (including 2hr sleep, reverse injuries, run 50k etc.) are not covered at all. They are key components of the books description page, but are left out of the audio entirely. Lame! Shame on whoever is in charge of selling this under false pretenses. I knew the book was abridged, but shouldn't it cover the highlighted points on Audibles' description page?",

The mindset seems to be this: For a person to be free and genuine, he must rewrite the rules and mores of society to his own liking, or at least refuse to acknowledge there are any.  The actions that flow from this mindset include: Refusing to accept that success takes hard work, cutting corners whenever possible, justifying any means by the ends, behaving and speaking in ways that have always been considered rude and inappropriate, defining success by income, fame, and 'rock-star' status, using shock-value to attract attention and prove courage and independence, and judging maturity, honesty, respect, self-sacrifice, and patience as worn-out, ridiculous principles that no longer apply to the modern world.  \r<br />In other words, apparently the goal is to live as long as possible as if we are still immature rebellious teenagers who want instant rewards without any responsibility.  Don't get me wrong, I too plan to become financially independent, enjoy free time, travel the world, and do what I am passionate about; but I don't agree that the path and mindset promoted in this book is the only way or the best way to get there.",

Ambitious, naive, and energetic, he has all the traits necessary for success, and he makes some good points about achievement and success, and having a positive outlook on life. He gets credit for that. For example, his assertion is correct that instead of striving to earn large amounts of money, we should decide what experiences or things we want out of life, and then work backwards from that to decide how much money we need. Also, the automation of income is truly the way to financial independence, and he's right on the money there. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>But his stories quickly get weird, even ridiculous. His accounts of tango contests and global sailing are quaint, but he loses credibility very quickly when he advises the reader on how to win a kickboxing contest: basically, he says game the system. And here is where his age shows. While taking advantage of technicalities in order to earn money might be legal and profitable, he misses the point on kickboxing. Isn't the point of learning to kickbox health, competition, discipline, defense? What value is a trophy if you only got it, as he basically did, though his opponents' forfeit? Did he really master kickboxing? Or did he just create the illusion of being better than his opponents? How deep is the joy one gets out of that? There are a number of assertions out there, in fact, that he never did win any national championship. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>If the goal is make people think you're successful, Ferriss is on to something. I hear he made his fortune selling a nutritional supplement that was never proven effective scientifically. Legal? Yes. Profitable? Hella. Does that make him trustworthy? Uh...&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Ultimately, happy people are those who enjoy the work they do, not people who spend even just four hours a week being miserable so they can sip mai tais the rest of the time. I want to read the book Tim Ferriss writes when he's 60, and has more perspective than he does now. TED should have waited as long to give him talk. ",

                    "body": "I am very well off, retired, and very happy (and have a zero hour work week), but I still read lots of self help books (along with many other subjects) to better understand the human condition and what works and what doesn't.  I find most self help books (including this one) largely just a updated &ldquo;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot; (a good book), but this author seems particularly slimy to me.  He describes his technique for winning a fighting competition by dehydrating himself to drop two weight classes then rehydrating before his bouts.  Then, instead of actually fighting, he used his weight advantage to push competitors out of the ring, winning on a technicality.  He points out this was out of the box thinking and within the rules.  Both true, but it was not within the spirit of the rules or of the competition.  It saddens me that others may emulate this fellow.\r<br />\r<br />One of things I have learned from the many self-help books I have read, is a large number of them are written by self-absorbed people who just want to get richer.  One thing I take from this (and the book Stumbling on Happiness) is, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t take advice from anyone you don&rsquo;t want to be like&rdquo;.  I absolutely do not want to be anything like this author.\r<br />\r<br />Next was a key aspect of book, &quot;what is your goal?&quot;  The author recommends using &quot;excitement&quot; as a better goal than &quot;Happiness&quot; as happiness is too vague.  Excitement is nice, but it is not happiness.  Excitement is easier to understand and measure than happiness, unfortunately excitement is ultimately unfulfilling and hollow.  Related to this is the author's idea of &ldquo;Dream-Lining&rdquo;.  This is a process of mapping out the costs and steps to achieve your dreams.  The part about documenting, costing, and steps are very good, but using your dreams as goals tends to be unwise.  Dreams are great, but tend not to be the best way of planning one&rsquo;s life.  This is well described in one of my favorite self-help books &ldquo;Stumbling on Happiness&rdquo;.  This author thus has goals that seem rather foolish to me&hellip;like travelling to Europe to go to all the &ldquo;hottest&rdquo; night clubs, or shooting lots of automatic weapons, and &ldquo;winning&rdquo; companions on technicalities.  It is indeed much harder to find what truly makes you happy than what excites you or what you dream about, yet this is truly at the core of every great self help book.  This is not that book.  He does point out that some people may have moral qualms about taking his advice (like advertising and selling things that don't really exist to see if there is a market, then cancelling the orders if you don't decide to go forward.)  I found quite a bit of the advice here to be mildly disgusting.  The author also seems to say there are many other techniques he uses that, for obvious reasons, he can't describe (I presume because these techniques are not just immoral, but illegal.) \r<br />\r<br />The best things said in this book are old, like Goethe&rsquo;s advice to DO IT &ndash; START IT NOW.  Decide on your goals and document concrete, achievable, steps, then do them.\r<br />\r<br />There is a lot of other technical advice in this book that is now largely obsolete as the technologies and services describe have changed.\r<br />\r<br />The narration was very good.",

                    "body": "**No spoilers**\r<br />\r<br />Atwood did so many things right with this book. It builds upon the world she created over 30 years ago, staying true to the form and style of the original, but with effective changes as well (e.g. the triple narrator). My favorite part was the fleshing out of a secondary character from &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot;, as that character moved into one of the narrator roles and gained both complexity and humanity.\r<br />\r<br />I am not experienced with literary analysis, but a few layman's observations that I would consider minor detractions are a slightly too streamlined/convenient plot to get one of the narrators advancing toward where she needed to be, as well as the pacing of the the final quarter of the book. I certainly understand things picking up as everything comes together, but it did seem both a little sudden and a little too quick. \r<br />\r<br />Is &quot;The Testaments&quot; as powerful and groundbreaking as &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot;? No, but I don't think any of us expected it to be. We have already been shocked by the Puritan-esque, post-revolutionary Iran-inspired world of the Republic of Gilead, but what Atwood does with &quot;The Testaments&quot; is give us vibrant, deep, rich characters who are inspiring and flawed and add another layer to the fictional land we know so well, while at the same time updating the implicit warning of &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; for the modern world.\r<br />\r<br />The audio production is fantastic. I listen at 3.5x, and everything sounded great. I did check the audio at normal speed, and some of you may find it a tad on the slow side, but that is easily remedied with the app. In this case, I found the multiple narrators very effective, as it really made the older character POP. The two younger character voices blended a bit in my mind, but they were both well done. As for Derek Jacobi... well, he's Derek Freakin' Jacobi!",

I hope so. Her Aunt Lydia backstory is better than what the show writers came up with. But she did take some things from the show which I liked. We’re in a weird age where a book written 35 or so years ago can suddenly become MORE famous that it was when it was written. I’m grateful to Hulu for the show- without which I may never have discovered Atwood and had the opportunity to read her books. <br />I only hope Atwood gives us another book for this series. Let’s make it a trilogy. Pre-quel perhaps? With some Nick and Serena backstory? <br /><br />",

                    "body": "I have re-read the original novel many times, and I think one of its major achievements is its poetic and insular nature--essentially making the rise of Gilead (and its reworking of society) a chamber piece in the the house at which Offred is stationed, and furthermore, in her mind during her many periods of musing during forced solitude and stillness. There is a lyricism to the prose in these moments that perfectly captures the mind spinning its wheels in boredom.\r<br /> The quote in that work about paintings of harems being not about sex but about boredom, about women in suspended animation, still haunts me. Offred is also an everywoman in the sense that she is not particularly courageous nor cunning, and this relatability makes the action sequences at the novel's end feel more earned and credible.\r<br />\r<br />The Testaments has none of those qualities. It traded in the silence and poetry of the former for plotting straight out of a &quot;B&quot; action movie. I laughed out loud when one character is put through a self defense regimen lifted from a Jason Statham movie or the like. I am a long time Atwood fan, but her worst tendencies are manifest here (as they were in her disappointing The Heart Goes Last, and to some extent, The MadAdam Trilogy)--cheesy wordplay, a feeling of Dickensian coincidence that is contrived at best, clunky humor before heart or logic. Its greatest strength lay in the acerbic wit of Aunt Lydia, who should have been the only narrator of the work. Atwood's ability to accurately depict the pettiness and cruelty of children and teenagers, evidenced in Cat's Eye and The Blind Assassin, is absent in the other two young narrators. One is a clich&eacute; of a capricious and petulant teen and the other failed to engage my interest entirely.",

                "<p>\"Narrator Ann Dowd, known for her role on the television adaptation, is formidable as Aunt Lydia. Hearing her resonant narration of diary entries allows listeners to feel the horror of early Gilead, be disturbed by the aunt's complicity, and discover her secrets. Bryce Dallas Howard's sweet narration of the Transcript of Witness Testimony 369A provides a window onto the extreme restrictions of girlhood in Gilead. Mae Whitman's snarky rendition of Witness 369B's testimony reflects a privileged youth in Canada, where she unwittingly triggers dramatic changes. Listening adds an entirely new dimension to a riveting tale. Atwood narrates section headings and her note, and Tantoo Cardinal and Derek Jacobi nail the scholarly conclusion.\" (<i>AudioFile</i> Magazine)</p>",

It will tell when to give more to your employer, or when to tone down your enthusiasm. It will warn you about going too far in your quest for power.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>If you really are a power-hungry maniac, this book will do just as much to help you reach your goals as it will if you are an average joe with no ambitions. I'm an idealist myself - I like to see the good in everyone and I don't like to think of myself as someone who wants &#34;power&#34; over other people.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>But that is not an excuse to avoid encountering the incredibly valuable information in this book. At the very least, it will keep you from making poor moves that will cause you to fall out of favor with others. At the most, you will be able to spot when someone else is playing &#34;the game&#34; and use their techniques against them. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>I don't like to play the game myself; I don't think power is a game. But I sure as hell like to watch the people who DO live like it's a game spin their wheels as they try and fail to pin me down and make themselves look totally incompetent in the process.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>If you're an honest person and if you think rewards and status should be earned by merit and not by raw power or deception, then your reputation and character will go before you and these laws of power will walk behind you. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Don't use this book to grow in power for power's sake. This is a fool's errand, and ends in your annihilation. Rather learn the laws of power to attain mastery over your own spirit, and to defend against those who would prey upon your honesty and integrity.",

This book seems to outline all the dirty tricks played by politicians to stay in power. The author seems to recommend some of the behavior we naturally disapprove of as an acceptable means to power. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>So why did I listen to the whole thing? I thought about returning the book after listening to the first chapter. But I realized that even though I may dislike these \"laws of power\" they are at play in the world I live in. And even thought I do not believe I will ever live by the majority of these laws, being aware of them has helped open my eyes to what is going on around me. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>So I would not highly recommend this book because there is little emphasis, if any, in character. But the book is useful in pointing out how people acquire and maintain power, and there is a benefit to being aware of how power can work. ",

Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne challenge everything you thought you knew about the requirements for strategic success. Recognized as one of the most iconic and impactful strategy books ever written, <i>Blue Ocean Strategy</i>, now updated with fresh content from the authors, argues that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors but from creating \"blue oceans\" - untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. </p> <p><i>Blue Ocean Strategy </i>presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any organization can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. This expanded edition includes: a new preface by the authors: \"Help! My Ocean Is Turning Red\"; updates on all cases and examples in the book; and two new chapters and an expanded third one - \"Alignment, Renewal, and Red Ocean Traps\" - that address some of the most pressing questions listeners and readers have asked over the years. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>",

As I came through this book (by a very random way) I started listening to it non stop... To make the long story short, I finally found what I’ve been looking for throughout all these years: a savior to my future. But not a person specifically, instead, a life long experience’s story kind of savior... It showed me that life is better when you always enter by “the third door”, and that possibilities are those that you make yourself. <br /><br />Thank you Alex for being brave enough to take on this journey. I’m forever grateful. <br /><br />Cordially, <br /><br />Laurimar Melendez ",

After remarkable one-on-one interviews with Bill Gates, Maya Angelou, Steve Wozniak, Jane Goodall, Larry King, Jessica Alba, Pitbull, Tim Ferriss, Quincy Jones, and many more, Alex discovered the one key they have in common: they all took the Third Door.</p> <p>Life, business, success...it’s just like a nightclub. There are always three ways in. There’s the First Door: the main entrance, where 99 percent of people wait in line, hoping to get in. The Second Door: the VIP entrance, where the billionaires and celebrities slip through. But what no one tells you is that there is always, always… the Third Door. It’s the entrance where you have to jump out of line, run down the alley, bang on the door 100 times, climb over the dumpster, crack open the window, sneak through the kitchen—there’s always a way in. Whether it’s how Bill Gates sold his first piece of software or how Steven Spielberg became the youngest studio director in Hollywood history, they all took the Third Door.</p>",

I&rsquo;m James Mitchell, the person who interrogated 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed (KSM). Some of what Gladwell writes confounds elements of different instances into unrelated events. These are factually incorrect, He could have cleared these up had he bothered to talk to me before he went to final print, but he didn&rsquo;t.  I won&rsquo;t address those here.\r<br />\r<br />More importantly, Gladwell implies that Enhanced Interrogation Techniques (EITs) were (1) used to pressure KSM into &ldquo;confessing&rdquo; to attacks; and (2), that efforts to question KSM about future attacks were marred because KSM was being subjected to EITs when he provided information that the CIA used to disrupt plots and capture or kill terrorists still at large. But, those two things are inaccurate. I know it makes for a better story, but that&rsquo;s just not what happened.\r<br />\r<br />EITs were never used to pressure KSM to &ldquo;confess&rdquo; to anything&hellip;period&hellip;full stop. And, EITs were not&mdash;let me repeat&mdash; not being applied when KSM provided information that helped CIA prevent a second wave of 9/11 style catastrophic attacks on the West coast or aided in the capture terrorists still at large. I explain all this in my book (Enhanced Interrogation) which can be found on audible. \r<br />\r<br />Finally, Gladwell makes much of KSM confessing in open court to a large variety of attacks and plots (including 9/11 and killing Daniel Pearl). Gladwell seems to be saying that KSM confessed to these things because, years after their brief use, the EITs compelled him to confess to things he didn&rsquo;t actually do. To be clear, we did not discuss many of the things on KSM&rsquo;s confessed list during his interrogations and debriefings. My guess is that if KSM confessed to crimes he didn&rsquo;t commit, then it was to imbed his true crimes in a list of bogus plots in order to cast doubt on his confession later, should he need to or simply to mess with court proceedings. It is not necessary to evoke the boogie man of cognitive impairment to explain KSMs duplicitous behavior. \r<br />\r<br />Readers interested in exploring this topic further should read the SSCI Minority Report dated June 20, 2014. That's the minority report, not the majority report.",

Why is there a description of a full-grown man inserting himself into a young boy?! how did that serve this book? I felt like this was more about shock factor and less about content. There could have been other ways to get to the fairly weak points he makes in this book.  \r<br />\r<br />I really wish I could have exchanged this book.

The last book I listened to was a little disappointing because there were a few instances in which the continuity of his logical analysis was broken. This book just got worse.  Maybe it is because I’ve listened to volumes more nonfiction since those first books or because I’ve now spent many years in scientific studies myself or because of formal instruction in literature review, and if I went back the same inconsistencies would be there in past books. Perhaps his analysis of a topic has gotten worse, I don’t know. In this book he tends to establish some premise (several times) that governs the interactions of strangers, citing researchers, landmark studies, and field experts, then he applies the premise unevenly to the topic, or even one sidedly. Moreover he applies landmark experimental findings to situations that they were never meant to define, this is logical fallacy. Experiments are highly specific, they are designed to test small ideas and eliminate as many confounding factors as possible, they cannot be so broadly applied. It’s dishonest and creates false conclusions or at very least un-validated conclusions. This book is rife with misapplied science and one sided or unbalanced applications of concepts.",

            "publisher_summary": "<p>Malcolm Gladwell, host of the podcast <i>Revisionist History</i> and author of the number-one <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>Outliers</i>, reinvents the audiobook in this immersive production of <i>Talking to Strangers</i>, a powerful examination of our interactions with people we don’t know. </p> <p>How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true? </p> <p>While tackling these questions, Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of <i>Talking to Strangers</i>, you’ll hear the voices of people he interviewed - scientists, criminologists, military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath, you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There’s even a theme song - Janelle Monae’s “Hell You Talmbout”. </p> <p>Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know. And because we don't know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world. </p> <p>The audiobook edition of <i>Talking to Strangers</i> was an instant number-one best seller, and was one of the most pre-ordered audiobooks in history. It seamlessly marries audiobooks and podcasts, creating a completely new and real listening experience. </p>",

The 80/20 principle - also known as the Pareto principle - is the well-verified observation that in business, economics, and life generally, about 80 percent of all results flow from a mere 20 percent of our efforts. In this thought-provoking and highly informative program, Richard Koch unveils the secrets to how this mysterious but practical principle actually works... how it is affecting your life right now... and how you can start using it to your advantage. You'll learn:</p> <ul> <li>How to identify the critical 20% in every area of your life</li> <li>How to give up the guilt of not working as hard as you think you're supposed to</li> <li>Why \"time management\" is a counter-productive fallacy</li> <li>The six things successful 80/20 practitioners do differently than you</li> <li>How to make the 80/20 Principle work for you in your job, even when you don't have total control over your time</li> <li>What the 80/20 Principle can teach you about who to hire</li> <li>How to avoid dooming yourself to life as a wage slave</li> <li>How the 80/20 principle can multiply your money</li> <li>And much more!</li> </ul> <p>The unspoken corollary of the 80/20 principle is that little of what you spend your time on actually enriches your life. But by concentrating instead on the few things that do matter, you can unlock the enormous potential of the critical 20 percent and multiply your happiness and fulfillment. When you learn how to systematically apply the 80/20 principle, you will finally have the power to transcend the pressures of modern life: to become more successful <i>and</i> to enjoy more leisure, serenity, and great relationships with friends and loved ones.</p>",

The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.

Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.</p> <p>Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, listeners will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.</p> <p>Learn how to:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy)</li> <li>Overcome a lack of motivation and willpower</li> <li>Design your environment to make success easier</li> <li>Get back on track when you fall off course</li> <li>And much more</li> </ul> <p><i>Atomic Habits</i> will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits - whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.</p>",

                    "body": "Well-written and wonderfully read, but what a whiney memoir it turns out to be of an exciting time and place, and also &mdash; odd for so good a writer &mdash; how inadequate to what she apparently imagines as what should be her rage.  I am sorry to say this, and I wanted more from the book.  \r<br />\r<br />What's good?  Her style is well-wrought, strong throughout.  And the reading its terrific.  \r<br />\r<br />What's not so good?  Well, there is a problem with the narrator:  Nothing is quite right for her, and, as she confesses repeatedly, although she is treated very well given her job, she is never convinced that this work in the tech trade is what she wants to do, or that her life or her trade has the virtue she thinks it should have, or that she is any good at it, or that the tech ethos is anything but corrupting.  She avoids consideration about the societal implications of her choices, and her condemnations tend to the aesthetic or merely descriptive.  She sees a homeless man wearing a sweatshirt from the company she works for, a beggar in swag.  &ldquo;It was the city&rsquo;s socioeconomic gap personified, I said. It felt even more significant that the man in the light-rail station was black, and not just because San Francisco was losing its black population at a rapid clip. To my knowledge, the company had just two black employees.&rdquo; Her co-worker listens to her story, described as &quot;a novelistic apparition, a hallucination,&quot; and says, &ldquo;I wonder whose it was &hellip; We&rsquo;re not supposed to give away the hoodies.&rdquo;  I suppose that that's honest in its descriptiveness, and so I should  be appreciative; but I wanted more.  Stylistically, I found that &quot;To my knowledge, the company had...&quot; not a judgment but an afterthought, an &quot;oh yeah and ...&quot; moment.  \r<br />\r<br />Other quibbles:  Her verbal pantomime with corporations becomes mere virtue signaling, tossing rocks from behind a fence &mdash; Facebook is the &ldquo;social network everyone hated,&rdquo; Edward Snowden is &ldquo;the NSA whistleblower who was back in media,&rdquo; Microsoft is the &ldquo;highly litigious Seattle-based software conglomerate.&rdquo;  Her catalogue of offenses &mdash; discrimination, antisemitism, racism, sexism &mdash; become, in effect, mere lists, as she writes them down but does not engage with them except ironically and as things that make her uncomfortable.  In fairness, at this point in the book, which is the second half of it, she is burned out.  Not from the work, which she describes as work from home barely getting out of bed, but from her own lack of engagement in it, her uncertainty about what she wants to do with her life.  \r<br />\r<br />So, I say it again:  the book is wonderfully written, witty through most of it, but the main character is surprisingly more self-centered and shallow than I had expected, and becomes wearying.  It is callow when it should be engaged and fierce.  Its style sometimes lapses into vacuous word games.  All in all it could have been a much better effort for someone with her obvious writing talent.  I look forward to her next book, however, which I am sure will be better.  ",

She moved from New York to San Francisco, where she landed at a big-data startup in the heart of the Silicon Valley bubble: A world of surreal extravagance, dubious success, and fresh-faced entrepreneurs hell-bent on domination, glory, and, of course, progress.</p> <p>Anna arrived amidst a massive cultural shift, as the tech industry rapidly transformed into a locus of wealth and power rivaling Wall Street. But amid the company ski vacations and in-office speakeasies, boyish camaraderie and ride-or-die corporate fealty, a new Silicon Valley began to emerge: One in far over its head, one that enriched itself at the expense of the idyllic future it claimed to be building.</p> <p>Part coming-age-story, part portrait of an already-bygone era, Anna Wiener’s memoir is a rare first-person glimpse into high-flying, reckless startup culture at a time of unchecked ambition, unregulated surveillance, wild fortune, and accelerating political power. With wit, candor, and heart, Anna deftly charts the tech industry’s shift from self-appointed world savior to democracy-endangering liability, alongside a personal narrative of aspiration, ambivalence, and disillusionment.</p> <p>Unsparing and incisive, <i>Uncanny Valley</i> is a cautionary tale, and a revelatory interrogation of a world reckoning with consequences its unwitting designers are only beginning to understand. </p> <p><b> A Macmillan Audio production from MCD</b></p>",

The technical details about his archiving system (it basically crawled a bunch of the published-within-IC sources and then indexed them, republishing for internal use, which allowed him perfect cover for exfiltration...) were still interesting, of course. That NSA had incredibly lax internal security and compartmentalization in the 1993-2013 period (due to losing all the cold war people and replacing them with...a specific demographic profile), CIA and State's technical incompetence, etc. are all pretty well supported by evidence. (Incidentally, the technical jack of all trades at CIA job sounds pretty amazing.)\r<br />\r<br />Least expected angle was just how impressive his wife is. NSA's initial angle was &quot;stripper&quot;, which brings a whole set of assumptions. However, this was pretty clearly inaccurate -- she's an intelligent and thoughtful person (although not involved in Snowden's exfiltration of data or escape), and based on actions since the incident (moving to Russia, marrying Snowden a year later, ...), seems\r<br />\r<br />His descriptions of contracting culture and the gov/contractor split, hypertrophy and metastasis of the IC and contractors, etc all are strongly supported by evidence (and my personal experience as a contractor with the government for several years).\r<br />\r<br />What is missing, and calls into question the veracity of the whole account, is the exact process of deciding to do all of this. In the book, it was that he accidentally saw a STLW (Stellar Wind) document, related to one of the most morally and legally questionable programs post-Church conducted by the USG (and for which individuals should be prosecuted and likely hanged), then just started searching for and consuming information for his own education (to see if these programs really existed), and only then decided to leak. That's possible, but it's not strongly supported. The mysterious occurrence of epilepsy around this time which motivated him to spend time on self-reflection and switching to a role with less of everything except access to this data, etc. seems a bit too convenient. This is the one area where I'm still a bit suspicious of the whole affair (either that an external power was involved, or that other NSA insiders supported him), but the story as told could also be the truth -- it's just difficult or impossible to validate.\r<br />\r<br />Overall, one of the best books about the complex and evolving interplay between young, relatively powerless individuals who have technical competence and thus effective technical control over large institutions like government vs. the official power structures, the failures of USG/IC, and one of the biggest news stories in civil liberties since the 1970s.",

The result would be an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the ability to pry into the private lives of every person on earth. Six years later, Snowden reveals for the very first time how he helped to build this system and why he was moved to expose it. </p> <p>Spanning the bucolic Beltway suburbs of his childhood and the clandestine CIA and NSA postings of his adulthood, <i>Permanent Record </i>is the extraordinary account of a bright young man who grew up online - a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and, in exile, the internet’s conscience. Written with wit, grace, passion, and an unflinching candor, <i>Permanent Record </i>is a crucial memoir of our digital age and destined to be a classic.</p>",

Possible spoilers below:  This book attempts to explain the beginnings or the First Order and the Resistance under General Leia, but that was already done in \\\"Bloodline\\\".   It's like I am reading multiple authors all trying to explain the same thing with TOTALLY different stories.   Yes they refer to Leia in this book as \\\"General Leia\\\", but she wasn't a General in Bloodline, which takes place 8 years later.   It's like Leia forms the resistance in this book, then goes back to being a princess in time for Bloodline, then forms another resistance without any memory of what happened before?  This book also talks about Leia being Pregnant - and she has visions of her son, and at another point she has visions of her having \\\"children\\\", as in multiple children.   This was a huge problem for me, because in Bloodline she has very clearly only had one child, so if Wendig is attempting to tease the audience with the possibility that Leia has a daughter, (Rey?!) We know that is impossible because in Bloodline they talk at length about Leia and her son.  Her relationship to her child (Ben) is significant in that book and if she had multiple children it would have been mentioned.   And if she DOES have another child it totally invalidates the other book.    And Thrawn, which was JUST revealed this past weekend as being canon....   wasn't ever mentioned.   Now I realize that Wendig was likely not permitted to mention Thrawn.  However, there are scenes in this book where they mention many previous Imperial Leaders, and those who were close and tight with Palpatine.   It just seems to me like Thrawn would HAVE to have been included in archives like that.  So Either Thrawn is going to be insignificant (which would be an absolute travesty) or he's going to die very quickly (equally tragic).  Point is : He should be a HUGE deal, and if books are going to discuss significant military leaders he deserves to be included in those discussions.   If Wendig wasn't allowed to mention him then I would have liked for it to be more open ended, something like \\\"and Admiral X, Grand Moff Y, and several others were also at that meeting\\\"... this way you could group him in with the \\\"several others\\\".    My fear is that with Disney allowing all these books to come out like polka dots all over the timeline, they are duplicating some of the exact same consistency problems that happened in the original EU.  If a book is going to reference MAJOR events that happened in the past, then you can't go back and add new events, without having to explain why they weren't ever mentioned before in the books that took place in it's future.    Imagine if they released another book, called \\\"Luke's Rise to Power\\\", which took place a month before Episode 4, where Luke stole a B-Wing and blew up 3 more Death Stars .  That is obviously an exaggeration but I feel that's almost where we are headed with the multiple explanations for the resistance and first order.  &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Again, this isn't a slam against this book or the author - this is something Disney needs to fix.

I am completely disappointed in this book and I can't believe I wasted my money on it. But Marc Thomason is the only saving grace in this terribly written story.",

As the New Republic fights to restore a lasting peace to the galaxy, some dare to imagine new beginnings and new destinies. For Han Solo, that means settling his last outstanding debt, by helping Chewbacca liberate the Wookiee’s homeworld of Kashyyyk. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Norra Wexley and her band of Imperial hunters pursue Grand Admiral Rae Sloane and the Empire’s remaining leadership across the galaxy. Even as more and more officers are brought to justice, Sloane continues to elude the New Republic, and Norra fears Sloane may be searching for a means to save the crumbling Empire from oblivion. But the hunt for Sloane is cut short when Norra receives an urgent request from Princess Leia Organa. The attempt to liberate Kashyyyk has carried Han Solo, Chewbacca, and a band of smugglers into an ambush—resulting in Chewie’s capture and Han’s disappearance. </p> <p>Breaking away from their official mission and racing toward the Millennium Falcon’s last known location, Norra and her crew prepare for any challenge that stands between them and their missing comrades. But they can’t anticipate the true depth of the danger that awaits them—or the ruthlessness of the enemy drawing them into his crosshairs.</p> <p>Praise for <i>Aftermath: Life Debt</i></p> <p>“Star Wars: Aftermath: Life Debt has found its place at the top of all the new canon works.

But the months following the Rebellion’s victory have not been easy. The fledgling New Republic has suffered a devastating attack from the Imperial remnant, forcing the new democracy to escalate its hunt for the hidden enemy. For her role in the deadly ambush, Grand Admiral Rae Sloane is the most wanted Imperial war criminal - and onetime rebel pilot Norra Wexley, back in service at Leia’s urgent request, is leading the hunt. But more than just loyalty to the New Republic drives Norra forward: Her husband was turned into a murderous pawn in Sloane’s assassination plot, and now she wants vengeance as much as justice. </p> <p>Sloane, too, is on a furious quest: pursuing the treacherous Gallius Rax to the barren planet Jakku. As the true mastermind behind the Empire’s devastating attack, Rax has led the Empire to its defining moment. The cunning strategist has gathered the powerful remnants of the Empire’s war machine, preparing to execute the late Emperor Palpatine’s final plan. As the Imperial fleet orbits Jakku, an armada of Republic fighters closes in to finish what began at Endor. Norra and her crew soar into the heart of an apocalyptic clash that will leave land and sky alike scorched. And the future of the galaxy will finally be decided. </p> <p>Praise for Chuck Wendig’s <i>Aftermath</i></p> <p>“<i>Star Wars: Aftermath</i> [reveals] what happened after the events of 1983’s <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. It turns out, there’s more than just the Empire for the good guys to worry about.” (<i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>)</p> <p>“The Force is strong with <i>Star Wars: Aftermath</i>.” (<i>Alternative Nation</i>)</p> <p>“The Star Wars universe is fresh and new again, and just as rich and mysterious as it always was.” (<i>Den of Geek!</i>)</p>",

                    "body": "To set the stage properly for this review, let it be understood up front that I am not one of those who despises the new canon.  Quite the reverse, of the 5 books released before this, I rated 4 of them with 5 stars, and the other not nearly so high.  It breaks my heart to write a review like this because it grieves me to say anything negative about Star Wars.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>There are a great many books on the roster right now involving the road to The Force Awakens.  Most of them seem to be filler, to be honest.  This one is beyond argument the most important one in this new “everything is canon” era.  A lot is riding on it.  There are a great many expectations for it.  There are a few minor spoilers in regards to world building, but I’ll try to be vague otherwise in consideration of those who’ve not read it and still want to.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>I still have trouble accepting the “everything is canon” idea.  I get it, but seeing as how there are already plenty of contradictions in how this galaxy is put together, I feel like that can’t last.  With that in mind, this is just another one in the line of books for me.  At the same time, though… planning has gone into it to make it more than that, and the weight of what this story offers feels legitimate in the grand sweeps.  Effort has been made here to show the progression of a single conflict from decades before the Clone Wars began, through the Imperial era, and up to this point in the saga.  Names change, and things are broken up for convenience.  But it’s all one big push.  This is one of the two major takeaways from this book for me.  It’s not a new concept, but I like that it’s acknowledged.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The other big takeaway is the big political picture, which has been a part of Star Wars from the beginning.  For a student of history like myself, it’s interesting to see the parallels.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>These are, for me, the good parts.  And that would have been enough to garner 3 or more stars had anything else made any sense whatsoever.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>This is my first encounter with Chuck Wendig as a writer.  As a long time Star Wars fan (like many who will read this book, and probably much like Wendig himself must claim), my judgment of his abilities hinges a great deal on this one book.  And, unfortunately, this one’s not a winner for me.  It’s not even a contender.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The first problem is the choice of writing style.  Writing in the present tense feels awkward and is inconsistent with the concept of myth-building a long-established story like this.  This story still takes place “a long time ago.”  It’s not happening now.  You can get used to it, but it’s just weird and inappropriate.  The worse offender is that his writing style is choppy so as to intensify the action.  It feels like the verbal equivalent of shaky “documentary style” handheld camera work to me.  It may work for some, but it’s an immediate put-off.  It’s reads like riding in a landspeeder, *ahem* car with someone driving who’s never operated a manual transmission.  I got mental whiplash from the experience.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The second problem is world building.  It’s just easier if I offer some examples, but the overarching theme at every turn is that the world building is abysmal.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>This story would have us believe that the average street urchin is familiar with the Jedi and phrases like “May the Force be with you.”  Even at their height, the Jedi weren’t numerous enough to be more than urban legend for most people.  There were, what, 10,000 of them compared to trillions upon trillions of beings across an entire galaxy?  That’s a drop in the bucket compared to most cities, to say nothing of a galaxy with that many overpopulated worlds.  Several of those worlds have many different concepts of religion and household gods, which the author actually references.  Many wouldn’t have known what the Force is, let alone be familiar with that catch phrase.  The Rebellion leaders use it because the founders of that group actually knew the Jedi and understood what their ideals were on some level.  That’s a very small, rare subset of people.  If Luke had to have Obi-Wan explain what the Force was, even knowing his father was a Jedi knight, then there’s no reason for the average person on the street to know either.  That’s just common sense.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>A more grievous misunderstanding is that somewhere along the lines, the Sith apparently put out an advertising campaign as every Imperial officer seems to know what they were and how they operated.  Even a random bounty hunter knows what a Sith is according to this book.  That’s nonsense.  I would counter by pointing out there were only two, nobody advertised it, and the entire reason they were successful is precisely because nobody knew who they were.  This would certainly have extended well through to Return of the Jedi.  There was precisely one Imperial officer that we know of who would have known anything about the Sith, and that’s Tarkin, due to his close association with Vader and Palpatine.  Who are these people that know so much about the nature of the Dark Side?  At least we got an explanation about one character in this book where it’s plausible, but the rest of them… c’mon.  The most secret and exclusive club in the history of the galaxy, and everyone’s in on it?  Please.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Related to that, this is the second novel in the new canon that has tossed in the idea that it’s well-known that Vader was a cyborg.  I would argue that Vader was the boogeyman.  Nobody knew who he was until he showed up, which is part of what made him so effective and terrifying.  Think about when Vader showed up in ’77.  Our perception was that we had no clue what he was.  Was he a man?  A droid?  A cyborg?  Something else entirely?  We didn’t know.  We didn’t even get a glimpse under the mask until The Empire Strikes Back.  At that point, we knew far more than the vast majority of the Star Wars galaxy.  Or is it known because there was a pop song about him, per Kevin Hearne?  I refuse to accept that as a viable explanation.  That’s bad writing, compounded by more bad writing.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>These are, to my mind, common misperceptions across casual fans, which would be understandable given where the films are focused.  For an author writing in the Galaxy Far, Far Away, supposedly with input from the Lucasfilm Story Group – some of whom who have actually outlined the above ideas to the public – these are rookie mistakes to apply such perceptions to the galaxy as a whole.  With so much riding on the perception of this novel going forward, it’s a bit offensive that I should have to lower my expectations to immerse myself in this universe.  That’s bantha poodoo.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Admittedly this is nitpicking, but that’s what world building is all about: details.  That’s why anyone’s reading this book.  We want the details of what happened between the original trilogy and the next film.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>But let’s compound it.  There’s a random scene where there’s graffiti on the wall with Vader’s helmet reading “Vader Lives.”  In front of that wall, a black market merchant sells a red lightsaber to a member of a Force death cult.  Neither are certain this is Vader’s, but the idea is for the cult member to destroy it so that he can send it back to its master in the great beyond.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>And that’s the thing.  There is almost no cohesive story.  There is the hint of one, and in between are these random sequences that are probably supposed to be easter eggs.  Maybe they’re for the later novels in this trilogy, or maybe they’re for the movie.  I don’t know.  I really don’t care.  It came across as sheer lunacy.  Need a random fight sequence with Dengar and some new bounty hunter named Mercurial Swift?  It’s in here.  Need a random scene of Han and Chewie, just to say you saw them?  Done.  How about a few scenes where Grand Admiral Ackbar makes references to traps?  You know, because everyone knows Star Wars exists solely on internet memes now instead of substance.  For the love of the Force, he’s not the first one who ever said the line!&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Not random enough?  Let’s add in a one-armed Wookiee for this scene because one-armed Wookiees are cool!  Did you know that Quarren have teeth?  Neither did I, but apparently they have dentists, so it must be true.  Is this really what passes for world building these days?  It’s pure amateur hour fluff, not even worthy of ranking as pop culture drivel.  Tell a story and quit winking at the fans, Skippy.  Han said to “Fly casual” in ROTJ, and now this is something he always says, to the point where Wedge – a character who wasn’t there when Han said it – knows it well enough to reference it?  Again, world building happens because of details, and this just falls apart all over the place here.  I’m sure all of this was designed to add a level of familiarity to make it feel like Star Wars.  It felt contrived.  And overall, the presentation was just sloppy beyond words.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>So let’s talk about the main characters of this story, because they aren’t the main characters of THE story.  There aren’t any characters in this to latch onto.  It’s more accurate for me to say that I couldn’t latch onto them.  I like seeing the progression of Admiral Rae Sloane.  But this illustrates my point.  She’s a side character, not a front runner.  So is pretty much everyone else in this story who steps into the spotlight, so far as I can tell.  If any of these characters make it to the big screen story that takes place 30 years later, I’ll reassess their worth.  For now, I’m not impressed enough to remember anyone else’s name.  Their functions as two-dimensional placeholders within the scope of the story is far more important than who they are.  Some of the primary characters in this tale finally started to get some development halfway through this book, but it wasn’t enough to make me care.  It seemed more like too many ideas were being flung at the walls to see what stuck rather than trying to demonstrate the diversity of the galaxy.  Perhaps there is something here the new canon will use better in other interpretations.  Maybe we’ll see an animated series that utilizes these characters set at this time.  I don’t have those answers.  All I know is they didn’t make an immediate impact the way characters from any other era of Star Wars has, and while I didn’t hate any of them by the end of the book, I didn’t love any of them either.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>To get you through this book, I propose a drinking game.  Every time you hear a mention of some kind of insect or arachnoid, take a drink.  Every time someone clucks their tongue, take two drinks.  If you don’t pass out first, it might make this lamentable mess more palatable.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The production on this audio is as top shelf as ever.  It’s always a pleasure to have Marc Thompson on board as narrator.  Backed by the classic sound effects and John Williams music, this story gets elevated beyond what it probably would have been than by print alone.  It’s a colossal waste and even an insult to the music of John Williams.  I trust Marc Thompson got well paid for his outstanding performance.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>As I say, this is my first experience with Chuck Wendig.  It will be my last.  I’m not inclined to explore more of his work, up to and including the other two parts of this trilogy.  This book feels more like incredibly bad fan fiction cobbled together in the back of a sandcrawler from spare parts more than anything mythical, magical, or worthy of the Star Wars brand.  But, thankfully, there are other writers and creative types involved that I trust, and this is a franchise that’s now far bigger than the sum of its parts, so I need not worry that the whole ship is doomed.  We’ve had other contributions that work, and we will again.  This one oscillated back and forth between almost competent and absurdly asinine so fast, I got nauseous.  It’s unfortunate that I walk away from this one with a sour taste for the future because of such an important cog in the clockwork to come.  I will also acknowledge that just because it didn’t work for me, that’s not to say it won’t work for other readers.  Ultimately, it’ll come to down to the reader’s personal tastes more than anything else.  For the curious, I’d still recommend it so they can judge for themselves.&lt;br/>",

I was optimistic that the story group would get an author that would give us some thing great. That didn't happen. I've never read any of Mr. Windig's other novels and this isn't a slight on his writing skills or story-telling ability. This is just not a good Star Wars novel. I suspect he was handcuffed by the amount of information he was able to reveal. I just don't care about these new, and in my opinion, minor characters. I expected Wedge at least to feature more prominently, but he spent almost the entire book strapped to an interrogation table and did almost nothing to move the plot along. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>I understand the need to keep The Force Awakens under wraps - I really do! But if you're not going to reveal more information, then what's the point of this book? I would have rather waited until after the movie and then got something with more teeth in it. We get almost NO major characters in this book. There's a short interlude with Han and Chewbacca, a brief glimpse of Leia in hologram form, and only small reference to Luke. Even the general state of the galaxy doesn't seem to be much of a surprise. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>There are brief moments of hope, particularly when an old &#34;adviser&#34; of Palpatine seems to be more than he appears. I thought some of his plot-line might lead to the First Order, but it doesn't really go anywhere. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>To Del Rey and the Story Group: If you're going to &#34;Legendize&#34; the old stuff and start the canon (a decision that I support!) then you've got to bring it, particularly with the first post ROTJ novel out of the gate. There will always be misfires - it's inevitable. But this book was just weak across the board. It hurts me to say it - it really does because I wanted this book to be good. It just isn't. ",

It turns out, there’s more than just the Empire for the good guys to worry about.”—</b><b><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></b><br /> <b> </b><br /> As the Empire reels from its critical defeats at the Battle of Endor, the Rebel Alliance—now a fledgling New Republic—presses its advantage by hunting down the enemy’s scattered forces before they can regroup and retaliate. But above the remote planet Akiva, an ominous show of the enemy’s strength is unfolding. Out on a lone reconnaissance mission, pilot Wedge Antilles watches Imperial Star Destroyers gather like birds of prey circling for a kill, but he’s taken captive before he can report back to the New Republic leaders.<br /> <br /> Meanwhile, on the planet’s surface, former rebel fighter Norra Wexley has returned to her native world—war weary, ready to reunite with her estranged son, and eager to build a new life in some distant place. But when Norra intercepts Wedge Antilles’s urgent distress call, she realizes her time as a freedom fighter is not yet over. What she doesn’t know is just how close the enemy is—or how decisive and dangerous her new mission will be.<br /> <br /> Determined to preserve the Empire’s power, the surviving Imperial elite are converging on Akiva for a top-secret emergency summit—to consolidate their forces and rally for a counterstrike. But they haven’t reckoned on Norra and her newfound allies—her technical-genius son, a Zabrak bounty hunter, and a reprobate Imperial defector—who are prepared to do whatever they must to end the Empire’s oppressive reign once and for all.</p>",
